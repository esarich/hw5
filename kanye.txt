I'm supporting the Democratic ticket in these midterms
Me and my wife met with President Obama two weeks ago
Sometimes I feel like just saying I love you isn’t strong enough to express how much I love you…
Happy Birthday baby!  Thank you for being the dopest wife &amp; mom! http://t.co/D3k20HN3Yb

The doors may be heavier, but I promise you WE WILL BREAK THEM.
Ten years later I am still the same kid from Chicago, still dreaming out loud, still banging on the door.
I wake up every day trying to give something back to you that you can rock to and be proud of.
I am honored and humbled by my fans, for the unwavering support and love over the past ten years.
gave of their heart to that project, and to all the projects that followed, and are to come.
I am extremely grateful to each and every person along that road who helped, lent an ear, lent their voice,
to not only convince my peers and the public that I could be an artist, but to actually get that art out for the world to hear.
I say "finally" because it was a long road, a constant struggle, and a true labor of love
Ten years ago today we finally released what had been my life's work up to that point: The College Dropout.

Thank you, Mandela, for your life's work and may it serve as a guiding light to illuminate our future.
At a young age my mother taught me the importance of his work. Mandela sacrificed his life for the betterment of mankind.
I'd like to address the false stories and noise that have been engineered by the media.
Despite recent media reports, I've never said anything to dishonor or trivialize the life or transition of one of the most inspiring leaders
Respect to Mandela, his family and his legacy.

I open the debate… The 2nd verse of New Slaves is the best rap verse of all time….meaning … OF ALL TIME IN THE HISTORY OF RAP MUSIC, PERIOD
http://t.co/hkUH7FrnNh
And to who ever leaked the video…     FUK YOU!
Allow me and Nick to give the world what we've been losing sleep over.
So any website that may have the unapproved / unfinished ruff. I ask you to please take it down.
The final version will be ready within the next week.
Me and Nick Knight have been working on this video for 5 months and for creatives it's heartbreaking when something like this happens.
The BLKKK SKKKN HD video that leaked yesterday was not the official version.
Thank you Jean Touitou for letting me create with you http://t.co/ctery9mHJA
This is not another "Robot" movie.   Guillermo del Toro is a master.
